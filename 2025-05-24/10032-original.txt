Middle East & Africa - Cyril Ramaphosa keeps his cool with Donald Trump

The episode underlined Donald Trump’s warped views of South Africa. Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, went to the Oval Office to salvage his country’s economic ties with America. But he was ambushed by his host, who dimmed the lights to show videos about what he has falsely called a “genocide” against white farmers. Mr Ramaphosa kept his cool. But the episode underlined Donald Trump’s warped views of South Africa—and how hard it will be to change them. The Trump administration has cut aid to Africa’s largest economy and seems set to cancel the preferential trade terms enjoyed by South Africa (and many other countries in the continent). It has also offered asylum to white South Africans; 59 have so far been granted refugee status.■Sign up to the Analysing Africa, a weekly newsletter that keeps you in the loop about the world’s youngest—and least understood—continent.
