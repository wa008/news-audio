Asia - Can India really innovate?

It has won the iPhone wars. What next?. India is becoming Apple’s factory floor. The world’s leading gadget-maker now assembles nearly one in five of its iPhones in the country. By 2026 it hopes to make all the handsets it sells in America in Indian plants, a shift that has irritated President Donald Trump. Foxconn, its biggest supplier, recently pledged another $1.5bn to expand local operations. It is not alone: over the past decade India’s electronics industry has grown five-fold. For firms looking to reduce their dependence on China, India is increasingly attractive.Yet Apple’s pivot also shows how far India still lags behind. The phones are assembled locally, but their guts—chips, batteries and camera modules—are mostly made in China. And China is not merely a manufacturing base. Its domestic firms, such as YMTC (which makes memory chips) and Sunny Optical (which supplies advanced camera modules), have climbed rapidly up the value chain. That has made China indispensable to Apple—not just for manufacturing, but as a place where local firms compete with global suppliers, giving Apple more choice and leverage.This reflects a broader problem. While India is rising as a base for assembly, it remains far behind in the kind of innovation that powers advanced manufacturing. India, which is now the world’s fourth-largest economy, remains a bit player in cutting-edge technologies. It spends $71bn a year on research and development (R&D), less than a tenth of America’s or China’s outlay. Its R&D intensity (spending as a share of GDP) is just 0.7%, compared with 3.6% in America and 2.4% in China (see chart 1). In an index published by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which ranks countries relative to their size and innovation capabilities, India ranks 39th. China is 11th; America is third.India is a bundle of contradictions. Its tech workforce is vast: the country has more open-source developers than China, second only to America. Its diaspora leads some of the world’s biggest tech firms, including Google, Microsoft and ibm. Yet it is largely absent from the race to build leading artificial intelligence (AI) models. Its drugmakers supply much of the world with generic drugs but have produced few original ones. In semiconductors India is home to around a fifth of the world’s chip designers, yet has few large chip firms.Indian universities, including the elite Indian Institutes of Technology, train talent for the world, but publish little world-class research. Not one Indian university ranks among the world’s top 100 for scientific research, according to the Nature Index, run by the publishers of the journal of the same name.For a country that wants to challenge China as a high-tech manufacturing hub, these shortcomings matter. Three problems hold India back: its firms invest too little in research; universities and labs rarely turn ideas into products; and entrepreneurs lack incentives to pursue risky, long-term innovation.Start with industry. In particularly innovative countries, the private sector leads R&D spending, typically accounting for around two-thirds of the total. In India, it contributes just over a third. Among the world’s top 2,000 corporate R&D spenders in 2023, only 15 were Indian. Together these firms invested about $5.9bn. Google alone spent $45bn that year. Tata Motors, a big Indian carmaker, accounts for over half of India’s corporate R&D spending, but most of that comes from its British subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover.Why are Indian firms so stingy? Some blame smaller company sizes and thin margins in a ruthlessly price-sensitive market. But even India’s most profitable outfits spend little. Naushad Forbes, an Indian businessman, notes that the five most profitable non-financial firms in India spend just 0.3% of their sales on R&D. In America the figure is 8.8%; in China, 2.1%. Even in export-facing sectors such as pharmaceuticals and software, Indian firms struggle to build serious research capacity. Infosys, a big Indian tech company, devotes only 0.6% of its $19bn in turnover to R&D. Mr Forbes dismisses the argument that India’s tech giants are mostly service firms; many Chinese ones are, too. The difference, he notes, is in mindset: many think they are spending enough, when by global standards, they are barely spending at all.The public sector performs little better. Indian academics are prolific: by number of publications, they rank third in the world, according to Scimago, a Spanish analytics firm. But on quality they lag. Measured by the “h-index”, which tracks how often work is cited, India slips to 19th place. Funding structures are partly to blame. Grants tend to go to institutions, not individual researchers. Hiring is slow and bureaucratic. The system discourages risk-taking and rarely rewards breakthrough ideas. Nor does academic work easily translate into commercial gain. A biotech entrepreneur in Bangalore notes that, unlike in America, where university partnerships often yield “marketable” products, Indian academics are content with little more than getting published.In 2023 the government launched the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), modelled on America’s National Science Foundation. It plans to spend $6bn over the next few years to boost research across universities and labs. Roughly 70% of the funding is meant to come from non-government sources, including private firms and philanthropies. Many remain sceptical. Susan Thomas of the XKDr Forum, a Mumbai-based think-tank, says the real issue is structural. Rather than keeping funds within state institutions, the government should outsource more research to private labs and independent centres. If the ANRF money “flows through the same old channels”, she warns, “we’ll get the same old results.”India’s startup sector, often held up as a bright spot, does little to close the gap. In April Piyush Goyal, the commerce minister, caused a stir when he asked founders whether they wanted to “make ice cream or build [semiconductor] chips”, a jab at the sector’s fixation on quick-delivery apps. He contrasted this with Chinese startups pouring money into electric vehicles and batteries. The criticism is not unfounded. Between 2017 and April this year, Indian “deep-tech” startups—those working in fields such as AI, computer vision and robotics—raised just $8bn, according to Tracxn, a research firm. That accounts for barely 5% of total startup funding in India in that period (see chart 2). Chinese deep-tech firms raised $6.4bn in 2024 alone.Entrepreneurs point to misaligned incentives. India’s patchy infrastructure presents firms with many challenges in consumer tech, such as quick delivery or digital payments, that are relatively easy to address and offer speedy returns. More complex pursuits, with longer payback periods, get far less attention. Access to long-term capital is also limited. Ganapathy Subramaniam at Yali Capital, a deep-tech fund, says that India has a lot of “micro funds” that can make small investments, but if a company needs $25m to $100m to scale, that is lacking.That may help explain why, despite being the second-most popular destination for American firms to set up R&D hubs (after Britain), India sees little domestic spillover into deep innovation.India’s space programme is an exception. It offers a rare example of successful public-private collaboration. In 2020 the government opened the space sector to private firms. Before that, companies could act as suppliers only to the Indian Space Research Organisation. A new agency, IN-SPACe, was created to grant private firms access to state-developed technology and infrastructure. So far, it has approved over 50 firms aiming to launch satellites and offer space-based services. Mr Forbes acknowledges the success of IN-SPACe but sees it as a special case—powered by a capable public agency and with a clear mandate. If India wants to be more than the world’s next assembly line, it needs to bring the same clarity of purpose that launched satellites into orbit to the far messier business of making innovation take off on Earth. ■Stay on top of our India coverage by signing up to Essential India, our free weekly newsletter.
